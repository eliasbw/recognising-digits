# Hopfield Networks!

We store patterns of five digits; 0 to 4, in a Hopfield Network using Hebb's rule.

The package enables us to easily draw images that the Hopfield model will try to recognise!

For example, this image was drawn in the GUI.

<img src="./img/gui_3.png" a="My attempt at a three" height="300"/>


And this is what the network recognised!


<img src="./img/gui_3.png" a="What the model found" height="300"/>
